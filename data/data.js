      "This is going to sound like a dig, but it’s meant as a compliment: The 2019 Acura RDX is much better than it needs to be. We’d had this thing in the long-term Autoweek fleet for a few months before I bothered getting behind the wheel. I wasn’t avoiding it, but there was no sense of urgency; some part of me figured that, the RDX being yet another compact crossover, I wasn’t missing much. A quick drive, just a commute from work and back, was an eye-opener: Here was a surprisingly direct, lively handler -- and it looked good in midrange A-Spec trim to boot (yes, big grille and big emblem and all). So when I needed to make a run to the East Coast and back, I had absolutely no problem grabbing the Acura key fob and settling in for the long haul. A few days and 1,000 miles later, initial impressions hold up. Not only does this vehicle feel distinct from, and notably more fun to drive than, the Honda CR-V (the RDX’s underpinnings are, after all, newer), I may actually prefer its strong, responsive turbo-four and substantial, but not artificially heavy, steering to those of, say, the Audi Q5. I know -- I’m as surprised as you are.",

About unresolved mysteries and the unifying Theories of Everything that may explain them, no matter how outlandishly. Now that we’ve nearly reached the end, here are a few remaining theories that may help clarify some of the show’s remaining mysteries or predict its final moments, in order of plausibility: Azor Ahai was an ancient hero whom followers of the Lord of Light believe is destined to be reborn as the Prince or Princess Who Was Promised. Melisandre believed this was Stannis, then she believed it was Jon, then she seemed to believe that Jon and Dany together might have something to do with it. The rest of the Red Temple priests and priestesses have been preaching all along that this is Dany.",

We talked politics mostly, a little about Facebook, a bit about our families. When the shadows grew long, I had to head out. I hugged his wife, Priscilla, and said goodbye to Mark. Since then, Mark’s personal reputation and the reputation of Facebook have taken a nose-dive. The company’s mistakes — the sloppy privacy practices that dropped tens of millions of users’ data into a political consulting firm’s lap; the slow response to Russian agents, violent rhetoric and fake news; and the unbounded drive to capture ever more of our time and attention — dominate the headlines. It’s been 15 years since I co-founded Facebook at Harvard, and I haven’t worked at the company in a decade. But I feel a sense of anger and responsibility.",

Over the last few years, Microsoft has tried to flip the narrative and win coders back. Last week, its master plan culminated in a major announcement: Microsoft will include Linux as part of the Windows 10 operating system, starting this summer. Hell has officially frozen over. This would have seemed impossible just a few years ago — but this is the new Microsoft. Years of hard work to redefine its business may finally pay off as developers are finally able to access a slate of modern tools to do their work on Windows.",

However, in reality, the framework as we currently know it was only released in 2016. React, initially released in 2013, only gained major publicity traction after Facebook changed their BSD license to MIT. In hindsight, the Angular team should have called it something else since it is so far removed and very different from the original Angular.js and just let that one die a slow silent death. So what’s the big deal with Angular? and why, exactly, are developers still using and recommending it?",

    body:
      "Ahead of time compilation (AOT) has been part of .NET ever since v1 of .NET framework came out. .NET framework had a technology called NGEN that allowed pre-generating native code and data structures at the time of installing a .NET program into the global assembly cache. NGEN created a cache of code and data structures the runtime would require to run the installed program. The cache was not complete — the runtime would fall back to doing just in time (JIT) compilation and loading when needed, but a great chunk of typical apps could be compiled ahead of time this way. The Mono runtime (synonym for Xamarin for many) then stretched this caching approach further, making it possible to run without any just in time code generation at runtime. Mono achieved this by making more investments into pre-generating code for generics and various stubs that NGEN left out. While this can be called ahead of time compilation in a way, it is quite different from how C, Go, Swift, or Rust are compiled ahead of time. The implementation of AOT compilation in the mainstream .NET runtimes leaves a lot of the AOT benefits on the table. This article will explore those benefits.",

    body:
      "During the 2015–16 N.B.A. season, Stephen Curry led the Golden State Warriors to a best-ever 73–9 regular-season record, before losing in dramatic fashion to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Finals, and the tectonics of basketball style and strategy—not only in the N.B.A., but beyond—shifted for good. Curry regularly launched shots from spots closer to half-court than to the three-point line, forcing defenders to cover more ground, drawing them away from the basket, and leaving a more or less open lane ripe for the slashing. This offensive approach, with variations shaped by differences in personnel and degrees of boldness, has become nearly de rigueur across the league—winners beget imitators, every time—and has had a palpable effect on players’ entire careers. Take Damian Lillard, of the Portland Trail Blazers, for instance, whose Curry-esque, thirty-seven-foot series-ending bomb against the Oklahoma City Thunder caused aftershocks that can still be felt across the league, and whose fearless chucking would seem baffling, or at least ill-advised, had there never been a Steph. Or consider that the “death lineup” trotted out, in crucial moments, by that Warriors team—Curry, Klay Thompson, Harrison Barnes, Andre Iguodala, and Draymond Green—which seemed an undersized anomaly enabled only by Curry’s constant threat to detonate, has, three seasons later, become the model for everyday starting fives on almost every team. If anybody is the progenitor of what is invariably (perhaps annoyingly) called “the modern N.B.A.,” it is Curry.",

      "Most people associate the Jurassic Period with depictions of feathered monsters gallivanting across the surface of Earth, establishing their claim as the dominant creatures of the planet. (And perhaps also Jeff Goldblum’s finest, most shirtless onscreen performance.) But we ought not to forget that the marine world was teeming with its own gargantuan beasts at the time. A 180 million-year-old fossil has led scientists to identify a new species of a marine crocodile possessing a tail fin not unlike modern-day dolphins. The discovery, reported Thursday in the journal PeerJ, ostensibly fills a missing link in the crocodile family’s evolutionary tree, reconciling a gap where they branched out and either continued to evolve into bony-armored creatures with limbs made for walking, or returned to the water to develop flippers and tail fins. A Hungarian collector named Attila Fitos first found the fossil in question in the Gerecse Mountains in 1996, and it’s sat in the Hungarian Natural History Museum in Budapest ever since. The research team decided to name the new species preserved in that fossil Magyarosuchus fitosi, in Fitos’s honor. That animal turns out to be an almost 16-foot long behemoth with an incredibly large, pointed snout made for snatching prey, a tail fin to help it swim, and body armor more closely associated with terrestrial reptiles. It’s thought to have been one of the biggest coastal predators of its time.",

    body:
      "We know spiders best as quiet, eight-legged monsters who lurk around and trap their prey with webs and venom. But 13 percent of the more than 450,000 arachnid species can aggressively stalk prey and lunge at them with a jump attack, like an eight-legged tiger, or a horrible version of Aragog’s children on steroids. Terrifying as it is, the way these spiders jump is worth studying. They can leap six times the distance of their body length from a standing start (humans can only manage a paltry 1.5 times their own length), and carry five times their weight into the air. Translating these physiological wonders into engineering strategies could revolutionize the type of robots we build and deploy—though hopefully not ones that lunge at human prey. A team of researchers from the University of Manchester in the UK ran a study that trained a regal jumping spider (Phidippus regius) named Kim to jump across various distances of a platformed obstacle course, all while ultra-high-speed videos took footage of the leaps. The new findings, published in Scientific Reports on Tuesday, provide a more detailed look at the jumping mechanism by which this species and others make extraordinarily long and precise leaps.",

Your gift of gag means you can expel gross or harmful things from your heaving guts. Rats can’t up-chuck things that could do them in, like poison. That’s obviously bad news for rodents. But for Linda Parker, a behavioral neuroscientist at the University of Guelph, it’s a blessing. Parker’s trying to get to the bottom of vomiting and nausea in human beings, and not-barfing rats are the key to her research.

There are now very few, if any, genuinely wild species of horse, which have never been domesticated. Scientists have known that Przewalski’s horse is not an ancestor of modern domestic horses, since studies were carried out on equine mitochondrial DNA in 2002. But now it seems that far from being the last remnants of a truly wild horse species, the Przewalski’s horse is the feral descendant of the domesticated Botai horses.",
